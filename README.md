# Web Tool for Navigating and Plotting The SomaLogic ADAT files

# Features
* BoxPlots
* Heatmap And Statistics
* PCA
* QC
* Explorer and discover new relationships

# Overview
This web app is written using the shiny framework, a package from RStudio that can be used to build interactive web pages with R. The code is split into two parts, the user interface and the server-side containing the logic. The HTML widgets framework is used for binding JavaScript data visualizations in R and numerous HTML widgets and R packages are used including plotly, DT, d3heatmap, shinydashboard and ggplot2.The user interface is currently organized into the following dashboard tabs: “Upload ADAT file”, “BoxPlots”, “Heatmap And Statistics”, “PCA”, “Download” and “Help”.
